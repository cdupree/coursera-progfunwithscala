This repo will contain my home submissions, and notes for Coursera's Functional Programming with Scala course.

Remember that if you come here, and just blindly copy these solutions you are cheating, and not just the course.  
Perhaps even more important than cheating in the class, you'll be depriving yourself of the grand opportunity
to learn to think in new ways about programming.
